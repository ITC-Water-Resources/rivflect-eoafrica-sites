# Leveraging inland radar altimetry over rivers with low cost GNSS reflectometry

RIVFLECT is a subproject within the [ESA's EO Africa Research and development facility](https://www.eoafrica-rd.org/research/research-projects-2023-2024/#proposal_4), running from 2023 to 2024. The goal of the project is to explore the possiblity of using low cost GNSS- interferometric reflectometry (GNSS-R) as a cross-validation tool for inland
